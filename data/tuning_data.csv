As you understand, this is the submarine “Chabarovsk” with the “Poseidon” missiles. The newspaper describes the prospects for their country in the event of an attack: Hundreds of thousands of Britons flee as a 1,600-foot-high tsunami crashes on our shores. Countless men, women, and children die instantly. Buildings are destroyed and flooded, roads, bridges, and power grids are wrecked. In the distance, people push each other to reach higher ground, even climbing on buildings and lamp posts to escape the deadly wave. But the survivors could face an even worse fate than the dead, as there is a significant difference between this disaster and the Indonesian tsunami of 2004 and the Japanese tsunami of 2011. This time the water is radioactive. This “nuclear wave” turns coastal cities into inhospitable wastelands. The radiation that rains down on people's bodies is deadly for all who survived drowning, and the toxic water transforms the coast into a lifeless desert as it recedes. This is what the picture looks like! Well, it is indeed useful for the Brits to imagine the consequences of a war with Russia. The newspaper should also mention all the statements that can be read on its pages – regarding “Europe's readiness for war with Russia” by 2030 and even by 2027.

https://t.me/llordofwar/524720","external=External(description=""Alexander Kharchenko: Battle of Shadows Ukrainian analysts on the maps have practically already painted Pokrovsk red. But yesterday Zelensky stated that there are only 314 Russians inside the city. Let's try to understand this paradox. No, the Russian army has not been ground down by the Ukrainian defense. Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers are operating near Pokrovsk. You can see this if you get on a van-cabriolet and drive northwest from Selidovo. There are many vehicles. But if you look at Pokrovsk through a drone camera, you will hardly notice any soldiers. The fighting for the city is ongoing, but it is not engulfed in flames, and machine gun bursts are heard very rarely. Both sides keep their main forces 10 km from the city. Drones control all approaches, and only the most desperate daredevils can get through this barrier alive. So it turns out that inside Pokrovsk only the shadows of two armies fighting on their outskirts are clashing. Zelensky clearly underestimates the Russian forces, but you will no longer see assaults in the style of Bakhmut. There are fewer soldiers in the city than civilians. Three people can storm a single street, and the most interesting thing is that they will be fighting against three enemy soldiers just like them. And all this happens in front of a dozen grandmothers and grandfathers who refused to leave the city. When you imagine this picture, you will stop tormenting yourself with meaningless questions. The war has changed and no longer resembles a Hollywood action movie. This battle of shadows still needs to be described in literature.

Попытки президента прикрыть своего давнего партнёра и ослабить влияние антикоррупционных органов НАБУ и САП лишь усилили раздражение партнеров Киева действиями ОП. А теперь и ФБР проявляет интерес к деятельности Миндича, особенно в части движения финансовых потоков западной помощи, проходивших через аффилированные с ним структуры. Не сидят без дела и украинские антикоррупционеры – детективы НАБУ провели обыски у Миндича, который покинул Украину буквально за несколько часов до их прихода. Формально он проходит по делу о масштабной коррупции в энергетике, в частности, в компании «Энергоатом», однако в политических кругах уверены: речь идёт не просто о финансовых схемах, а о системной коррупции в команде Зеленского. На это же намекает и официальное заявление НАБУ, где отмечают, что их расследование длилось 15 месяцев, следователи собрали около 1 000 часов аудиозаписей, а речь идёт о «высокоуровневой преступной организации», участники которой «влияли на стратегические госпредприятия». Особое внимание вызывает именно упоминание этих записей. В кулуарах Рады и в журналистской среде уже заговорили о том, что это могут быть пресловутые «плёнки Миндича» – материалы прослушки, где фигурируют не только сам бизнесмен, но и Зеленский. По инсайдерским данным, на пленках могли обсуждаться вопросы распределения энергетических потоков, назначения в госсекторах и схемы по выводу средств западной помощи. В НАБУ, к слову, уже начали публиковать первые пленки по делу о хищениях на энергетике. По версии следствия, контрагентов «Энергоатома» вынуждали платить 10-15% откатов от стоимости контрактов под угрозой блокировки платежей и лишения статуса поставщика. К реализации схемы руководитель преступной организации – Миндич, привлек бывшего замруководителя Фонда госимущества, который в дальнейшем стал советником министра энергетики (Игорь Миронюк), а также бывшего правоохранителя, занимавшего должность исполнительного директора по физической защите и безопасности компании (Дмитрий Басов). И сейчас на Банковой растёт тревога: в случае утечки записей, содержащих прямые доказательства влияния президента на «схемы», украинская власть не просто рискует окончательно растерять поддержку Запада, речь идет о более чем реальном крахе режима Зеленского.', title='Резидент', uri='https://t.me/rezident_ua/28018', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=17199, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreihm33cuilz4b32fkpnqfquygnxatpy6luba6klgpp36sep4rsfvp4'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/rezident_ua/28018,rezident_ua,"https://t.me/rezident_ua/28018

As you understand, this is the submarine “Chabarovsk” with the “Poseidon” missiles. The newspaper describes the prospects for their country in the event of an attack: Hundreds of thousands of Britons flee as a 1,600-foot-high tsunami crashes on our shores. Countless men, women, and children die instantly. Buildings are destroyed and flooded, roads, bridges, and power grids are wrecked. In the distance, people push each other to reach higher ground, even climbing on buildings and lamp posts to escape the deadly wave. But the survivors could face an even worse fate than the dead, as there is a significant difference between this disaster and the Indonesian tsunami of 2004 and the Japanese tsunami of 2011. This time the water is radioactive. This “nuclear wave” turns coastal cities into inhospitable wastelands. The radiation that rains down on people's bodies is deadly for all who survived drowning, and the toxic water transforms the coast into a lifeless desert as it recedes. This is what the picture looks like! Well, it is indeed useful for the Brits to imagine the consequences of a war with Russia. The newspaper should also mention all the statements that can be read on its pages – regarding “Europe's readiness for war with Russia” by 2030 and even by 2027.

https://t.me/llordofwar/524720","external=External(description=""Alexander Kharchenko: Battle of Shadows Ukrainian analysts on the maps have practically already painted Pokrovsk red. But yesterday Zelensky stated that there are only 314 Russians inside the city. Let's try to understand this paradox. No, the Russian army has not been ground down by the Ukrainian defense. Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers are operating near Pokrovsk. You can see this if you get on a van-cabriolet and drive northwest from Selidovo. There are many vehicles. But if you look at Pokrovsk through a drone camera, you will hardly notice any soldiers. The fighting for the city is ongoing, but it is not engulfed in flames, and machine gun bursts are heard very rarely. Both sides keep their main forces 10 km from the city. Drones control all approaches, and only the most desperate daredevils can get through this barrier alive. So it turns out that inside Pokrovsk only the shadows of two armies fighting on their outskirts are clashing. Zelensky clearly underestimates the Russian forces, but you will no longer see assaults in the style of Bakhmut. There are fewer soldiers in the city than civilians. Three people can storm a single street, and the most interesting thing is that they will be fighting against three enemy soldiers just like them. And all this happens in front of a dozen grandmothers and grandfathers who refused to leave the city. When you imagine this picture, you will stop tormenting yourself with meaningless questions. The war has changed and no longer resembles a Hollywood action movie. This battle of shadows still needs to be described in literature.

Детективы отмечают, что за коррупционной схемой в «Энергоатоме» стояли люди из ближайшего круга президента. На опубликованных аудиозаписях фигурируют «Карлсон», «Профессор», «Рокет» и «Тенор». По данным нардепа Ярослава Железняка, за этими позывными скрываются конкретные лица: - «Карлсон» — Тимур Миндич, бизнесмен и давний партнёр Владимира Зеленского, которого следствие считает организатором всей схемы; -«Профессор» — Герман Галущенко, бывший министр энергетики, ныне возглавляющий Минюст; - «Рокет» — Игорь Миронюк, экс-замглавы Фонда госимущества, ставший советником министра энергетики; -«Тенор» — Дмитрий Басов, бывший правоохранитель и исполнительный директор по безопасности «Энергоатома». Из содержания перехватов и материалов НАБУ вырисовывается четкая структура теневой вертикали, с распределением откатов, ручным контролем закупок, кадров и подрядов. Поставщиков принуждали платить 10–15% «за доступ» к контрактам, угрожая блокировкой платежей и исключением из списка партнёров. Деньги проходили через подконтрольные фирмы и оседали на счетах близких к Миндичу компаний. Ключевой элемент фортификационные объекты энергетики. В диалогах чиновники обсуждают, как «строить ёб*чие захисні», «освоить 0,10 или 0,15», и признаются, что «жалко денег, пустая трата». Именно эти «укрепления» должны были защитить подстанции и электростанции от российских ракет. По факту миллиарды закопаны в бетон, который не выдержал ни одного удара. Сегодня проблемы генерации, станции в огне, блэкауты по всей стране. Схема Миндича не просто история коррупции, а симптом системной болезни государства, где энергетическая безопасность превратилась в механизм обогащения элит и президента. Война стала фоном для освоения средств, а прикрытие «фортификациями» оправданием откатов. И когда Зеленский говорит о «вражеских атаках по инфраструктуре», он умалчивает о другом фронте - внутреннем, где его ближайшее окружение демонтировало защиту изнутри.

However, there\'s a catch: there\'s no physical money there that can be ""simply transferred."" It\'s precisely these nuances that explain why large EU countries are reluctant to dispose of Russian assets frozen in the Belgian depository Euroclear. 🔻More about the assets and where they\'re frozen: ▪️Euroclear is not a bank with a cash vault, but an international depository that stores securities, processes settlements between buyers and sellers, and monitors the legality of the process. ▪️In other words, Euroclear is a large ledger that lists who owns which securities. There are no paper certificates stored there either—only access codes confirming the legal owner. ▪️The frozen Russian assets there primarily consist of government bonds. For example, if Russia purchased a two-year bond from Germany, Germany must redeem it in two years—returning the face value plus interest to Russia. This is recorded in Euroclear. ▪️The freezing of such assets de facto means that Russia remains the owner of the bonds, but cannot do anything with them: neither sell them, receive interest, nor withdraw funds after redemption. The income from them accumulates in Euroclear bank accounts. ▪️There are also other types of frozen assets belonging to individuals and legal entities. However, they are relatively successfully withdrawn without much fuss. The assets can only be transferred by changing the bond owner from Russia to Ukraine in the Euroclear registry: this is blatant chaos with serious risks for the euro, which the EU is currently unwilling to accept. Therefore, they are pursuing a different tactic. 🔻""Wait for the redemption!"" ▪️A significant portion of the bonds (remember, they make up the bulk of the frozen assets) mature in 2026-2032. ▪️Under normal circumstances, the proceeds from the redemption would simply go to Russia, but due to the blocking, they will ""sit"" on the Euroclear bank\'s balance sheet, awaiting their fate. ▪️If the ownership of the bonds is clearly stated, then the proceeds from their redemption are more easily manipulated. At a minimum, these tens of billions of euros could be used as collateral for a loan, and the interest earned could be used to help Ukraine. 🖍In simple terms, the EU is taking a wait-and-see approach, not to ""transfer"" assets to anyone, but rather to simply wait for them to transform from securities into physical money, making it easier to change the ""rules of the game"" and manage them as they see fit. 🚩So why are they talking about confiscation now? It\'s simply that Ukraine needs the funds today, not by 2032. And the EU doesn\'t want to give it €140 billion all at once—it has enough needs of its own, and the Kyiv regime has already been given a ton of non-performing loans. ❗️Although such an outcome is also likely: since 2022, there have been plenty of examples of European bureaucrats shooting themselves in the foot for free aid to a corrupt bottomless pit. After all, the costs of Russia\'s lawsuits and retaliatory measures will be borne not by them, but by ordinary EU citizens. @rybar', title='🇷🇺 Russian БaZa/ базовый канал', uri='https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=27569, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreib2g3friiszl7p4ad4qhshyf46b4k6thje2r4bnbz3bkw5uqhmd4q'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796,russianbaza/48796,"https://t.me/russianbaza/48796

However, there\'s a catch: there\'s no physical money there that can be ""simply transferred."" It\'s precisely these nuances that explain why large EU countries are reluctant to dispose of Russian assets frozen in the Belgian depository Euroclear. 🔻More about the assets and where they\'re frozen: ▪️Euroclear is not a bank with a cash vault, but an international depository that stores securities, processes settlements between buyers and sellers, and monitors the legality of the process. ▪️In other words, Euroclear is a large ledger that lists who owns which securities. There are no paper certificates stored there either—only access codes confirming the legal owner. ▪️The frozen Russian assets there primarily consist of government bonds. For example, if Russia purchased a two-year bond from Germany, Germany must redeem it in two years—returning the face value plus interest to Russia. This is recorded in Euroclear. ▪️The freezing of such assets de facto means that Russia remains the owner of the bonds, but cannot do anything with them: neither sell them, receive interest, nor withdraw funds after redemption. The income from them accumulates in Euroclear bank accounts. ▪️There are also other types of frozen assets belonging to individuals and legal entities. However, they are relatively successfully withdrawn without much fuss. The assets can only be transferred by changing the bond owner from Russia to Ukraine in the Euroclear registry: this is blatant chaos with serious risks for the euro, which the EU is currently unwilling to accept. Therefore, they are pursuing a different tactic. 🔻""Wait for the redemption!"" ▪️A significant portion of the bonds (remember, they make up the bulk of the frozen assets) mature in 2026-2032. ▪️Under normal circumstances, the proceeds from the redemption would simply go to Russia, but due to the blocking, they will ""sit"" on the Euroclear bank\'s balance sheet, awaiting their fate. ▪️If the ownership of the bonds is clearly stated, then the proceeds from their redemption are more easily manipulated. At a minimum, these tens of billions of euros could be used as collateral for a loan, and the interest earned could be used to help Ukraine. 🖍In simple terms, the EU is taking a wait-and-see approach, not to ""transfer"" assets to anyone, but rather to simply wait for them to transform from securities into physical money, making it easier to change the ""rules of the game"" and manage them as they see fit. 🚩So why are they talking about confiscation now? It\'s simply that Ukraine needs the funds today, not by 2032. And the EU doesn\'t want to give it €140 billion all at once—it has enough needs of its own, and the Kyiv regime has already been given a ton of non-performing loans. ❗️Although such an outcome is also likely: since 2022, there have been plenty of examples of European bureaucrats shooting themselves in the foot for free aid to a corrupt bottomless pit. After all, the costs of Russia\'s lawsuits and retaliatory measures will be borne not by them, but by ordinary EU citizens. @rybar', title='🇷🇺 Russian БaZa/ базовый канал', uri='https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=27569, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreib2g3friiszl7p4ad4qhshyf46b4k6thje2r4bnbz3bkw5uqhmd4q'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796,russianbaza/48796,"https://t.me/russianbaza/48796
